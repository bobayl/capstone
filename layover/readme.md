What is the purpose of "LAYOVER"? Think of it being a "TripAdvisor"-like application designed and tailored especially for airline flight and cabin crew, flying to and staying for short periods (24hrs up to 1 week) at different destinations again and again. It shall allow to share the best experiences (restaurants, excursions, sports, shopping tipps and more) amongst each other within the company. First-timers at a destination (which can be the entire crew if the airline is flying to a new destination in its route network) spend a lot of time to find the best places and then these places are normally shared mouth-to-mouth. Some very special and places and hidden secrets are "lost" when a crewmember resigns or retires.

How does "LAYOVER" work for the user? After signing up (sign up process currently not yet restricted), users can add places to existing destinations in the app but also add new destinations as the airline network is constantly changing. The user can use the Google Places Autocomplete API function to search for Google places and add them. Place that do not exist in Google Places can also be added manually. To add a place, the user selects the destination, the category, subcategory (a new one can be created if necessary), picks a title image and can optionally add a comment.

Places can be edited by the user who added them (and even be deleted). Places can be commented by other users.

For each destination exists a list view of all places, sorted by category. The user can switch to a map view displaying markers for all the places of that destination
